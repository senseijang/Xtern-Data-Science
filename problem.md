# Data Science
## Situation 

In order to make the XTern program the best summer internship program for the participants, the Data Science team is focusing its efforts on helping the XTerns to explore local stores, shops, and destinations. The Data Science team also takes on the challenge to plan a fun day for all the XTerns with tons of activities.  

## Your Task 

Utilize the open-source map API such as Google Map API, OpenStreetMap, AWS Map API to collect useful data on local stores, shops, and destinations. Clean and organize your data then present it as a table or data frame. Such table or data frame of local stores, shops, and destinations should contain basic information about those locations such as name, address, rating, website, and type. See Example_Data.csv for an example list. 

Review the data and draw any conclusions you can find from the data set you gathered. Present a one-day (9:00 AM - 9:00 PM) activities plan with time, location name, address, activity type, and duration. See Example_Plan.csv for an example plan. 

Demonstrate your findings using data visualization tools and well-written explanations. As an important member of the team, you get to come up with your own analysis and explain it! So try your best to dig out any useful information from this data set. Sky is the limit! ðŸ¤“ 

## FAQ 

What if I cannot download the data file? 
If switching browsers does not resolve the issue, please reach out to x@techpoint.org and we will email you a direct copy of the file at our earliest convenience. 
Where can I go find the data I needed? 
Google is your friend! There are tons of free API that provide useful data around business locations and details. 
Is there a required tool for the data analysis? 
There is no required tool for the analysis, however, some tools may be better suited for this type of data and work. (Hint: R and Python) 
Where should I submit my solution? 
Your research and conclusions should be submitted as a link to a GitHub repository or Google Colab. It is encouraged that your repository hosts a Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebook. 
Oh no, this is so hard. Where should I start? 
Data Science projects are complex and open-ended and thatâ€™s why itâ€™s super fun to come up with solutions. Take a deep breath and create a plan to meet the project requirements one by one. Everything will be ok! 
Submission Directions

Prepare your conclusions from the data set, including the components described above. Your research and conclusions should be submitted as a link to a github repository. It is encouraged that your repository hosts a Jupyter (formerly iPython) notebook. 

To reduce bias in the process, please do not add your name or other identifying information to the responses you give on the work sample. This will help ensure students are evaluated based on their work and experience.
