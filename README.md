### Overview
The purpose of this project was to submit a data science project for **Xtern 2023**.  
Using the **Google Maps Geocoding and Places API**, attractions / points of interest were found in Indianapolis, IN.  
Using these data points, some analysis on the types of attractions and their ratings were done.
Afterwords, a day plan was assembled in **Indianapolis-Day-Plan.xlsx**
